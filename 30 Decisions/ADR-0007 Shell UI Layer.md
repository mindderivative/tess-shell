# ADR-0007: Shell UI layer

> [!summary]
> The shell builds on tre alone, so it must supply what tre leaves out: a way to describe views, reactive values, a theme and a small widget set. This ADR proposes a small layer owned by the shell, sized to the surfaces in [[V1 Scope]].

> [!important] Proposed
> The maintainer has not chosen. Only the maintainer moves this to `accepted` ([[AGENTS#2. Hard rules]], rule 5).

## Context

tre provides mechanism only: nodes, layout, paint, animation, input, text, accessibility, layers and shaders. It has no widgets, no theme and no file I/O ([[AGENTS#1. What Tesserae Shell is]]). The shell therefore owns:

| Need | Why the shell needs it |
|---|---|
| A view description | The vision promises YAML views edited by a shell author ([[Goals and Non-Goals]] G1, [[Personas and Use Cases]] P1, P2). |
| Reactive values | Modules push changes (clock, battery, volume) into views from other threads, through `LoopHandle.call_soon` ([[AGENTS#3. Layering principle]]). |
| Theme and design tokens | One look across bar, popups and OSDs, light and dark, high contrast, reduced motion ([[Goals and Non-Goals]] G7). |
| A widget set | Text, icon, button, row, column, slider, list, image, menu item, tray icon. |
| Live reload | Saving a view or theme updates open surfaces ([[Goals and Non-Goals]] G2). |
| Errors with position | `file:line:column` for every config mistake ([[AGENTS#3. Layering principle]]). |

What Tesserae has for reference (not a dependency): a YAML view language with Python ViewModels, `Signal`/`Computed`/`Effect`, Material Design 3 components, themes, stylesheets and hot reload ([Tesserae overview](https://mindderivative.github.io/tesserae/)). Its source is the maintainer's own, so its design can be read freely.

## Options

### Option A — A small shell-owned layer on tre (recommended)

The shell defines a YAML view format limited to what surfaces need, a small reactive core, a token-based theme and about a dozen widgets, all built on tre nodes. It reads Tesserae's design for guidance and shares no code.

- **For:** one dependency (tre); a view format shaped for surfaces, monitors and modules; no coupling to Tesserae's release or scope; keeps [[ADR-0006 Shell Independent of Tesserae UI]] literal.
- **Against:** new work: parser, binding, reactive core, theme, widgets, hot reload, error reporting. Two similar-looking YAML formats exist across the maintainer's projects.

### Option B — Copy parts of Tesserae into the shell

Take the reactive core, theme code and widgets as a one-time copy and let them diverge.

- **For:** faster start.
- **Against:** a fork the maintainer must keep in step by hand; defects fixed in one place stay in the other; unclear licensing and ownership of the copy over time.

### Option C — Extract a shared core package from Tesserae

Split Tesserae into a core (reactivity, theme, view language) and an app layer, and let the shell depend on the core only.

- **For:** one implementation.
- **Against:** needs Tesserae to be restructured, which is the load the maintainer wants to avoid, and still couples the shell to Tesserae's releases.

## Decision

Blank until the maintainer chooses.

## Consequences

If Option A is accepted:
- `41 YAML Reference/` defines the shell's view format, theme file and shell file types from scratch, and `42 Python API/` defines the reactive core and the module contract.
- `50 Design System/` owns the tokens and widgets. It may reuse Material Design 3 ideas; that is a design choice, not a dependency.
- `20 Architecture` gains a UI layer between tre and the shell runtime.
- The widget list is fixed by [[V1 Scope]] surfaces and modules. Anything beyond it needs a reason.
- Size and cost are estimated before the first spec is `stable`. #needs-verification

## Open items

- [ ] Choose an option.
- [ ] If A: set the widget list for v1 and the limits of the view format (conditions, repeaters, imports).
- [ ] If A: decide whether view files keep Tesserae-style names (`<Name>_View.yaml`).
- [ ] If A: decide how a module's values reach a view (a ViewModel class, a plain dict, or a signal registry).
